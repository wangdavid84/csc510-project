Sync Ends is an automated bridge to sync service owners and service consumers. Every team has a single postman collection that they use to test their APIs and share it across in their documentations. The backend team has to register their service on our application and we take care of the rest. Everytime there is a change in the way the api is called, we parse the changes and inform the consumers. This way all the team members are informed about the changes and know exactly what to edit in their product. The [Slack](https://slack.com/) framework lets you concentrate on the `core` functionality you want to build without worrying about integration overheads.

## Setup

### Postman 
1. Sign in to [Postman](https://identity.getpostman.com/login)
2. If you do not have any pre-exiting collections on Postman, import this sample [collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/dfa93d217bf211237c8f)
3. To integrate with the Sync Ends service, a Postman API key is required. Generate API key by visiting this [page](https://web.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys)
4. Copy the generated API key. This is required during the time of execution
5. For the CLI version, you will be asked to provide the API key during execuaton
6. For the Slack version, if you ask for app service, our app will ask you to provide the API key from Slack

### Create a slack team and slackbot

Follow the below steps to create a slack team and then a slack bot.

### Creating Slack team
1. Open https://slack.com/
2. Provide your email ID. Select Create New workspace. 
3. Check your email and enter the code to verify your email.
4. Provide your name and set a password
5. Add some details to your team in the next page
6. Provide a company name
7. Team URL should be unique - Also remember this URL - this is what is used to login to your slack instance
8. Agree with the terms
9. Skip the invite step
10. You are up and running with your own instance of Slack.

Now that team is created, let us create a slack bot

### Creating Slack bot
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps/
2. Select Create New App at the top
3. Give it whatever name you like
4. In the Development Slack Workspace manuel, select the workspace you just created
5. It should bring you to the Basic information page now
6. Select Add features and functionality 
7. Select Bots and then check Always Show My Bot as Online and Messages Tab
8. Select Permissions, then in the Bot Token Scopes select Add an OAuth Scope add all the following:
![](https://github.com/JialinC/csc510-project/blob/master/etc/OAuthscope.png)
9. Select Install App then copy the OAuth Access Token. 
Ex: xoxp-1412629584949-1415718378626-1437384197463-adbd7cda4d39487a2adaeba74cc8468c
You will need this in future set up
10. Go back to the the Basic information page and select Event Subscriptions
11. Check Enable Events
12. Follow this link https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api to set up the Slack event API
We will need to subcribe to these event:
![](https://github.com/JialinC/csc510-project/blob/master/etc/event.png)


# Execution
Create a file called .env, you can follow the env_default file to see what is needed. Copy your SLACKBOT_TOKEN and
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET into the file. Then everything should work fine.

# Testing
We offer a CLI version and a Slack APP version. Both should work by just run the code in src. You can follow the introduction video to do functionality test.

# Known issue
While the PyPI package is called slackclient, you import the module using the name slack:
```
from slack import WebClient
```
You may find this not work on your first try, before you change moudle name or try to get the old version of slackclient, simply uninstall slackclient then install it again may give you a easy fix.

The current app 'bots' we are using does not have the right to create a channel, so I crate my own app and give it the right to create channel. The link is here https://api.slack.com/apps After go to this page just click Create New App, give it whatever name you want and a workplace you want to add it. Then I selected Permission to add the permission we need. Simply give this link  https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize as the Redirect URLs. After this in the Bots Token Scope section choose add an OAuth scope.
Based on the api we are using:
conversations.list needs: channels:read  groups:read  im:read mpim:read
conversations.create needs: channels:manage  groups:write  im:write  mpim:write
chat.postMessage needs: chat:write
We can add more along the way when we need new scope.
After add all these permissions, just choose install app, and you will get a token that can be used.
